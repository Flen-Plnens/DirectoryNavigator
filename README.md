# DirectoryNavigator
DirectoryNavigator is a lightweight PHP-based directory navigation system that allows you to create a simple and intuitive navigation interface for your directories.

### Features

- List and navigate through directories and subdirectories.
- Automatically generate links to each directory.
- Display custom titles for directories based on an index.txt file.

### Requirements

- PHP (version 5.3.0 or higher)
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Upload the files to your web server.
3. Set the appropriate file permissions for the directories and files (e.g., make sure they are readable by the web server).

### Usage

1. Place the DirectoryNavigator files in the root directory or the directory you want to navigate.
2. Access the DirectoryNavigator in your web browser by visiting the appropriate URL.
3. You will see a list of directories with clickable links. If an index.txt file exists in a directory, its content will be used as the title for the link.

### Customization

- Modify the `config.php` file to adjust the configuration settings.
- Customize the CSS styles in the style.css file to match your desired design.
